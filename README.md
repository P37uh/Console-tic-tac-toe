# What is this?
Tic-tac-toe it's a game with the following rules:
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

# How can i use it?
Just download .exe and open it.

# For what is this?
Although there are already many implementations of tic-tac-toe, much more convenient to use and with more features, I released my own.
Why? Just for practising in git and py.

# What will be in the future?
For now, I am planning to add a machine learning model, that will play with you.
And I'll fix all the bugs I can find during this process.
